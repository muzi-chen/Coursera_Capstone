    "**Helsinki** is the capital city of Finland with a population of 657,674. Together with the cities of Espoo, Vantaa, and Kauniainen, and surrounding commuter towns, Helsinki forms the Greater Helsinki metropolitan area (Uusimaa), which has a population of over 1.5 million. This area is the country's most important center for politics, education, finance, culture, and research. The urbanization and development of the uusimaa area has brought great opportunities for the tertiary sectory business, including catering. Considering someone is seeking for a suitable place in Helsinki to open a restaurant, he or she must be interested in how restaurants are situated in this city, the types of restaurants and the surrounding venues of the restaurants, i.e. other venues in the same neighborhood. My project will provide an analysis of the 60 neighborhoods in Helsinki area, mainly focusing on the restaurants and other popular venues in each neighborhood. The neighborhoods will finally be segmented into several clusters based on the venues situation. For those seeking for a suitble location to open a restaurant, this analysis may provide some clues."
